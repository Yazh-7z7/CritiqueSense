# CritiqueSense
Intelligent Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with NLP & Machine Learning

CritiqueSense is a sentiment analysis platform that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and traditional machine learning models. The project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

# Features
Automated Sentiment Classification: Predicts positive or negative sentiment from movie reviews.

Multiple ML Models: Includes Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest for comparison.

Advanced Text Processing: Cleans, tokenizes, lemmatizes, and vectorizes review text.

Interactive Visualizations: Generates word clouds, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

Real-Time Prediction: Analyze custom reviews with instant sentiment feedback.

# Getting Started 
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Yazh-7z7/CritiqueSense.git
cd CritiqueSense 
2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
 
3. Run the Notebook
Open notebooks/CritiqueSense.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and follow the instructions to execute each cell.
Example Results
Word Clouds: Visualize the most common words in positive and negative reviews.

Model Comparison: Bar charts to compare the accuracy of different ML models.

ROC Curve: Evaluate model performance with ROC/AUC metrics.

Confusion Matrix: Understand prediction breakdowns.

Usage
Run the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and visualize results.

Test the sentiment of your own movie review by editing the test section in the notebook.
